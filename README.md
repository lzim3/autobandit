# autobandit
Hopper's Roppers Intro to Computing Fundamentals Capstone project


Not executed exactly as asked in the lesson. Created a function to establish the connection to bandit level 0 and incremented by 1 after the password is retrieved. Decided to use a separate .py file to store the bash commands as key:value pairs needed to complete the individual levels, this allows the program to work without config files. Completes levels 0-10.

Requires pwntools library(https://github.com/r3p3r/Gallopsled-pwntools-tutorial) and both .py files included to run.
